## Experiments

Further info about the experiments is found in the experiments chapter of this work.

### PR_1 (wip)

Running different types of predicates (data, metadata, none, data and metadata, etc) against some datasets.


### PR_2

Studying the intrinsic nature of the predicate.




### PO_1 (wip)

The experiment PO 1 investigates the performance of contexts when the policies operate on data, metadata, roles, etc.

### PO_3 (wip)

Number of policies per context.


### DO_X

```
I cannot run **DO_X** experiments until I have the context-sync mechanism in place
```

### DO_1

Investigate the context performance as the node-cardinality of its domain changes

### DO_2

data-cardinality of domain

### DO_3

size of domain

### DO_4

some nodes are temporarily faulty/not available



### CO_1 (wip)

Change in node-cardinality of codomain.

### CO_2 (wip)

One or more nodes are unavailable.


### CO_2




### Scale_1

This is an experiment where multiple nodes interact with each other in order to achieve an equilibrium state.
